## PHP Thread safety note:
##
## Speaking only of Unix-based environments, you only have to think of PHP thread safety if you are going to use PHP with Apache web server, 
## in which case you are advised to go with the 'prefork' MPM of Apache, which doesn't use threads, and therefore, PHP thread-safety doesn't matter.
## Usually all GNU/Linux distributions will take that decision for you when you are installing Apache + PHP through their package system,  
## without even prompting you for a choice. 
## If you are going to use other webservers such as nginx or lighttpd, you won't have the option to embed PHP into them anyway. 
## You will be looking at using FastCGI or something equal which works in a different model where PHP is totally outside of the web server 
## with multiple PHP processes used for answering requests through e.g. FastCGI. For such cases, thread-safety also doesn't matter. 
##
## FastCGI is a binary 'protocol' for interfacing interactive programs with a web server. 
## It is a variation on the earlier Common Gateway Interface (CGI). 
## FastCGI is a method for executing dynamic program code from a web server. It is a very fast method which for the most part leaves 
## the server untouched and runs the application on a separate daemon. 
## To increase the speed, FastCGI provides multiple instances of this daemon, allowing requests to be processed without having to wait. 
## In practice, this is a promising gain in performance and, more importantly, an architecture that saves memory.
## 
## FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative 'PHP FastCGI implementation' with some additional features (mostly) useful for heavy-loaded sites.
## Configuration file: php-fpm.conf
## systemctl enable php-fpm.service
## systemctl start php-fpm.service
##
## mod_fcgid is an Apache module that uses the FastCGI protocol to provide an interface between Apache and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs.
##
## Running PHP through mod_fcgid helps to reduce the amount of system resources used by forcing the web server to act as a proxy and only pass 
## files ending with the .php file extension to PHP-FPM.
##
## Files required to be uploaded:
## 1) cp 09-fcgid.conf 
## 2) cp 10-fcgid.conf 

script_dir="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
